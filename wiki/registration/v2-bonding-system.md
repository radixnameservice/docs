# RNS V2 Bonding System

---

> **Status:** ✅ **APPROVED** - Community governance vote has passed, V2 will be implemented

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT MIGRATION COST WARNING:** If you purchase domains now (V1), you will need to commit **additional funds** to migrate to V2. Your V1 purchase costs (XRD) are **NOT recoverable** during migration. V2 migration requires bonding new funds (xUSDC/sUSD) at standard bond amounts. Consider this before purchasing domains in the current system.

The Radix Name Service (RNS) community has voted to approve a major upgrade (V2) that will enhance the existing forever asset system. While domains are already permanent in the current system, V2 will introduce a "bonding" mechanism that allows fund retrieval and transitions RNS to a fully open-source project.

## RNS Evolution Through Community Governance

### Three-Phase Evolution
RNS has evolved through multiple community votes:

1. **Phase 1 - Original System:** Domains required annual renewals, had expiration dates, grace periods, and lapse auctions
2. **Phase 2 - Forever Assets (Previous Vote):** Community voted to eliminate renewals and make domains permanent one-time purchases
3. **Phase 3 - V2 Bonding (Recent Vote):** Community approved bonding system for fund retrievability while maintaining forever asset nature

### Why These Changes Were Made

**Forever Assets Vote (Previous):**
- Eliminated user anxiety about losing domains
- Removed complex renewal management
- Simplified user experience
- Provided true digital ownership

**V2 Bonding Vote (Recent):**
- Adds fund retrievability to forever assets
- Transitions to stable currency (xUSDC/sUSD)
- Supports move to fully open-source project
- Provides natural trading floor prices

## Key Changes in V2

### Enhanced Forever Assets
- **Current System:** Domains are forever assets with one-time XRD payments
- **New V2:** Domains remain forever assets but use retrievable bonds in xUSDC/sUSD
- Users "bond" funds to domains (similar to staking) and can retrieve them later
- Bonded funds can be fully retrieved by "unbonding" the domain

### Currency & Retrievability  
- **Current System:** One-time payments in XRD equivalent (non-retrievable)
- **New V2:** Bonds paid in xUSDC or sUSD (fully retrievable)

### Governance Structure
- Transition from formal DAO to fully open-source project
- Move away from revenue-generating model

## Current System vs V2 Comparison

| Feature | Current System | V2 Bonding System |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Domain Duration** | Forever | Forever (until unbonded) |
| **Expiration** | Never | Never (unless you unbond) |
| **Renewals Required** | No | No |
| **Payment Currency** | XRD equivalent | xUSDC/sUSD |
| **Fund Retrieval** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (but domain is burned) |
| **Keep Domain + Get Money Back** | ❌ No | ❌ No (choose one or the other) |
| **Auctions** | ❌ Removed | ❌ None |
| **Settlements** | ❌ Removed | ❌ None |
| **Registration** | Immediate | Immediate |

## How V2 Bonding Works

### Bonding Process (Registration)
1. **Search** for available domain through any registrar interface
2. **Bond funds** by signing a transaction that bonds xUSDC or sUSD to the domain
3. **Claim domain** - the domain NFT is immediately yours
4. **Keep domain** - as long as the bond remains, the domain is yours

### Bond Amounts
The bond amounts follow the same pricing structure as the current system:

| Domain Length | Bond Amount | Example |
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| 2 characters | $240 | hi.xrd |
| 3 characters | $120 | hey.xrd |
| 4 characters | $40 | hola.xrd |
| 5+ characters | $4 | hello.xrd |

**Additional Costs:**
- Registrars may add optional "registrar fees" on top of bond amounts
- These fees allow registrars to compete and earn revenue for their services

### Unbonding Process (Fund Retrieval)
**⚠️ Important: Unbonding burns your domain**

1. **Visit any registrar** interface
2. **Sign unbond transaction** - this **BURNS the domain NFT**
3. **Receive funds** - bonded xUSDC/sUSD is immediately returned
4. **Domain becomes available** - can be registered by anyone following normal bonding process

**Key Points:**
- ✅ You get your bond money back (xUSDC/sUSD)
- ❌ **You lose the domain** - it's burned
- ❌ You cannot use the domain anymore after unbonding
- ⚠️ **This is irreversible** - you can't get the same domain back unless you re-register it

### Alternative Disposal
- **Trading:** Domains can be traded on marketplaces like Trove (keeps domain + gets money)
- **No restrictions:** Domains are freely transferable  
- **Floor price:** Bond amount provides a natural floor price for trading
- **Alternative to unbonding:** Trading lets you monetize the domain while preserving ownership, unlike unbonding which destroys it

### Two Ways to Exit/Monetize in V2:
1. **Trading (Preserve Domain):** Sell domain on marketplace → Get money + buyer gets domain
2. **Unbonding (Destroy Domain):** Burn domain → Get bond back + domain is gone forever

## Migration for Existing Domains

### ⚠️ Critical Migration Cost Information

**V1 Purchase Costs are NOT Recoverable:**
- Funds spent on V1 domain purchases (XRD) cannot be retrieved
- V2 migration requires **NEW bond amounts** in xUSDC/sUSD
- This is essentially a **second payment** to upgrade your domain
- Bond amounts follow the standard pricing (see table below)

**Example Migration Cost:**
- You bought `hello.xrd` in V1 for $4 worth of XRD ❌ *Not recoverable*
- To migrate to V2, you must bond **another** $4 in xUSDC/sUSD ⚠️ *Additional cost* 
- After migration, you can unbond to retrieve the $4 xUSDC/sUSD ✅ *Future retrieval*
- **Total Commitment:** $8 ($4 V1 + $4 V2 bond)

### Migration Bond Requirements

| Domain Length | V2 Bond Required | V1 Cost (Lost) | Total Commitment |
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| 2 characters | $240 xUSDC/sUSD | $240 XRD | $480 total |
| 3 characters | $120 xUSDC/sUSD | $120 XRD | $240 total |
| 4 characters | $40 xUSDC/sUSD | $40 XRD | $80 total |
| 5+ characters | $4 xUSDC/sUSD | $4 XRD | $8 total |

### What Happens to Current Domains
- **Governance vote passed:** Existing domains will need to be migrated to the V2 system
- **Migration requires new funds:** Bond amounts must be paid separately from V1 costs
- **V1 costs are sunk costs:** Cannot be recovered or applied toward V2 bonds
- Current domains remain forever assets and are fully protected

### Migration Process
1. **Upgrade interface** will be provided by XRD Domains
2. **Simple user interface** will prompt users to "upgrade" their domains
3. **Batch transactions** available for users with multiple domains (within Radix Engine limits)
4. **Domain functionality** - unmigrated domains will lose RNS functionality but remain in wallets
5. **Name protection** - existing domain names are reserved and cannot be duplicated

### If You Do Nothing
- Existing domains remain in your possession and control
- Domains will lose RNS functionality until upgraded (once V2 launches)
- Domain names are protected from duplication in the new system

## FAQ

### System Changes
**Q: Are domains already forever assets?**
A: Yes! Domains are already forever assets in the current system with no expiration. V2 enhances this by making your bond retrievable.

### Multiple Domains
**Q: Will each domain need to be bonded individually?**
A: Yes, each domain requires its own bond, just like each currently has its own purchase price. Registrars may provide batch bonding capabilities within Radix Engine limits.

### Subdomains
**Q: How are subdomains affected?**
A: Subdomains are not individual assets - only the root domain needs bonding. If a root domain is unbonded, all associated subdomains and records are burned.

### Technical Implementation
**Q: When will V2 launch?**
A: The community governance vote has passed. Launch timeline will be announced by the development team.

### Current Domain Security
**Q: Are my current domains safe during this transition?**
A: Yes, existing domains remain under your control. Once V2 launches, you'll have time to migrate them through a user-friendly interface.

### Migration Benefits
**Q: Why should I migrate if my domains are already forever?**
A: V2 migration provides **bond retrievability (by burning the domain)**, stable currency bonds, trading floor prices, and supports the transition to a fully open-source project.

### Unbonding Details  
**Q: How does unbonding work?**
A: Unbonding **burns your domain** and returns the bond funds. You cannot keep the domain and get the money back - it's one or the other. There are two different ways to monetize: trading on marketplaces or unbonding for bond retrieval.

**Q: Can I get my bond back and keep my domain?**
A: **No.** Unbonding burns the domain NFT. For both money and domain preservation, domains can be sold/traded on marketplaces.

**Q: Is unbonding reversible?**
A: **No.** Once unbonded, the domain is burned. You'd have to re-register it (if still available) and pay the bond amount again.

**Q: What are the options for exiting a bonded domain?**
A: There are two methods: **Trading** (sell domain on marketplace → get money + buyer gets domain) or **Unbonding** (burn domain → get bond back + domain is destroyed). These have different outcomes and implications.

### Migration Costs
**Q: Can I get my V1 purchase money back during V2 migration?**
A: **No.** V1 purchase costs (XRD) are permanent and cannot be recovered. V2 migration requires new bond funds (xUSDC/sUSD) in addition to what you already paid.

**Q: How much will V2 migration cost me?**
A: You'll need to pay the full bond amount for each domain (same as current pricing) in xUSDC/sUSD. This is on top of what you already paid in V1.

**Q: Is V2 migration worth the additional cost?**
A: V2 provides bond retrievability (by burning the domain), stable currency, and trading floor prices. The additional financial commitment required is a decision each user must make based on their own circumstances and needs.

**Q: Should I wait to buy domains until V2 launches?**
A: There are trade-offs to both approaches. Purchasing in V1 now means paying migration costs later but secures the name immediately. Waiting for V2 means paying once but risks someone else claiming the domain. Users should evaluate their own priorities and circumstances.
