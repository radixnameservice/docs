# Base Pricing

---

Domains are subject to a base pricing schedule, denominated in $ and is payable in the XRD equivalent at the point of purchase. Base pricing can be considered as the floor price that a purchaser pays if the domain settles without contest from another interested party. Base pricing also applies to domain name renewals.

The current base pricing schedule is as follows:
<br /><br />

| Domain Length | Base Price <small>($ equivalent)</small> | Example |
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| 2 characters | $240 per year | hi.xrd |
| 3 characters | $120 per year | hey.xrd |
| 4 characters | $40 per year | hola.xrd |
| 5+ characters | $4 per year | hello.xrd |

> #### This is quite expensive, no?

This pricing schedule is the cheapest among many different name services out there. We predict that based on character length, domains with the intended use of utility will cost $4, which is much cheaper when compared with Web2. Character length plays a big role in the base pricing schedule, which is a standard protocol for Web3 name services; Any domains that are perceived as valuable will likely always attract multiple interested parties and will therefore go to auction, however, again the base pricing is much cheaper than if one were to pick up a valuable domain via a marketplace / acquisition.

To note: The RNS Foundation is considering a 50% discount where $RNS is used for domain purchases.

> #### From where is the pricing derived?

Base pricing and corresponding pricing mechanisms are governed by the RNS Foundation. The pricing is fixed to the XRD 90 day moving average (currently 0.045 XRD to the dollar) and will be reviewed by the RNS supervisory board every 90 days OR if the underlying price of XRD / USD moves + or - 20% within any given 7 day period. Any changes to pricing will require a 1st degree amendment to be tabled and voted upon within the RNS DAO (more info to follow once the DAO platform is live).

> #### Do domains expire?

Yes, domains expire at the end of the annual term, unless of course the domains are renewed.
<br /><br />

> #### How much are renewals?

Renwals are subject to the same base pricing above.

> #### Why isn't the RNS based on single purchase (lifetime) domains?

The initial specification is based on the stance that the lack of incentives to build out comprehensive name services around single purchase domains is detrimental to their existence. A well-utilized and adopted name service requires high-quality services, innovation, superior UX, and governance. A reasonable, small fee that's deposited into a treasury, then dispersed in the form of builders grants creates an incentive mechanism and subsequent economy that enables vendors to fulfil these requirements into perpetuity. An ecosystem of this nature also allows the name service to adapt in an agile manner as longer-term trends emerge and shifts occur. The RNS aims to be a vibrant ecosystem of open standards, with multiple, innovative developers working together to extend the service and build tooling for these domains to ensure that they can be utilised outside of the current bounds we see today. Subsequent value then comes full circle for domain owners, accordingly - It's probably safe to say that nobody likes a 'ghost' asset.
