# Renewal Lifecycle

---

All domains are valid for a year and, unless renewed will expire. Renewals are subject to the standard flat [base purchase price](wiki/registration/base-pricing.md) and can be renewed within 30 days of expiration. If the current owner decides not to renew a domain at the end of its renewal period, it enters the "grace period", which lasts a further 30 days. During this time, the domain records will no longer function, but the domain can be renewed and reactivated by its current owner under the standard pricing structure.

## Lapse Auctions

If an owner decides not to renew a domain at the end of its grace period, it enters a ‘lapse auction’ for 72 hours. $RNS holders can partake in lapse auction; 75% of the winning bid is awarded to the previous domain owner and the remaining 25% is sent to the RNS Foundation treasury. Losing auction participants can claim back their total bid commitments once the auction is complete.

If a domain receives no bids at the end of a lapse auction, the domain drops back into general availability. The term is simply used to define a domain that was once owned, has expired and is now generally available.

## FAQ

---

> #### If I win at auction, will the renewal costs always be in line with the amount I paid for the bid?

Short answer no. It will almost certainly be way cheaper, because domain renewals always follow the [base pricing schedule](wiki/registration/base-pricing.md).
