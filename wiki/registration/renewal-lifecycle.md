# Domain Lifecycle

---

> **🎉 V2 APPROVED:** The RNS community has voted to approve the V2 upgrade! Domains are already forever assets in the current system with no expiry or renewals. V2 will introduce a "bonding" system that allows you to retrieve your bond. See the [RNS V2 Bonding System](wiki/registration/v2-bonding-system.md) for full details.

## Current System: Forever Assets

Domains in RNS are **forever assets** with no expiration dates or renewal requirements. Once you purchase a domain, it's yours with no additional costs.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **No expiration dates** - domains never expire
- ✅ **No renewal fees** - one-time purchase only  
- ✅ **Permanent ownership** - yours forever once purchased
- ✅ **Immediate activation** - domains work immediately after purchase
- ⚠️ **V2 migration required** - current domains will need migration to V2 bonding system

## What Happened to Renewals?

Renewals, grace periods, and lapse auctions have been **completely removed** from RNS. The system has been simplified to provide permanent domain ownership through one-time purchases.

**Removed features:**
- ❌ Annual renewal fees
- ❌ Grace periods  
- ❌ Lapse auctions
- ❌ Domain expiration
- ❌ Renewal reminders

## V2 Migration (When Available)

While domains are already forever assets, V2 will introduce additional benefits:

### Current Forever Assets vs V2 Bonding
| Feature | Current System | V2 Bonding System |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Ownership Duration** | Forever | Forever |
| **Payment** | One-time (XRD) | Retrievable bond (xUSDC/sUSD) |
| **Get Money Back** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (unbond) |
| **Expiration** | Never | Never |
| **Migration Required** | N/A | ✅ Required |

### Benefits of V2 Bonding
- **Retrievable Bond**: Get your money back by unbonding
- **Stable currency**: Use xUSDC/sUSD instead of XRD
- **Trading floor price**: Bond amount sets natural minimum price
- **Open source**: Support transition to fully open-source project

## FAQ

---

> #### Do I need to do anything with my current domains?

Not immediately. Your current domains remain yours forever. When V2 launches, you'll have the option to migrate them to the bonding system for additional benefits.

> #### What if I don't migrate to V2?

Your domains will remain in your possession but may lose some RNS functionality until migrated. Domain names are protected from duplication in V2.

> #### Can I still lose my domain somehow?

No. Domains are forever assets in both the current system and V2. The only way to "lose" a domain in V2 would be to voluntarily unbond it to retrieve your funds.

> #### When do I need to migrate?

Migration timeline will be announced when V2 is ready to launch. You'll have a user-friendly interface to migrate your domains when the time comes.
