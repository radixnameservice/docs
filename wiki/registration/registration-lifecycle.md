# Registration Lifecycle

---

> **🎉 V2 APPROVED:** The RNS community has voted to approve the V2 upgrade! While domains are already forever assets in the current system, V2 will introduce a "bonding" system that will require migration. See the [RNS V2 Bonding System](wiki/registration/v2-bonding-system.md) for full details.

## Current Registration Process

Acquiring a domain involves searching for an available domain and, if available, purchasing it at the [base purchase price](wiki/registration/base-pricing.md). Once purchased, the domain is immediately yours as a forever asset with no expiration dates.

**Key features of the current system:**
- ✅ Domains are forever assets (no expiration)
- ✅ No auction process required
- ✅ No settlement periods
- ✅ Immediate ownership upon purchase
- ⚠️ Will require migration to V2 bonding system when launched

## Process

---

The registration process is now simplified:

1. **Search** for available domain through any registrar interface
2. **Purchase** domain at base price (paid in XRD equivalent)
3. **Own forever** - domain is immediately yours with no expiration

## FAQ

---

> #### The process is much simpler now - what happened to auctions and settlements?

Auctions and settlement periods have been removed from RNS. Domains are now forever assets that can be purchased immediately at base price without complex bidding processes.

> #### Do I still need to worry about V2 migration?

Yes, while domains are already forever assets in the current system, V2 will introduce a bonding mechanism that provides additional benefits. All current domain holders will need to migrate their domains to the V2 system (commit a bond amount) once it launches in order to use their domains - this of course is optional for users who just wish to hold onto the asset rights, rather than utilise a domain for its use case.

> #### What's the difference between current forever assets and V2 bonding?

The current system makes domains forever assets paid for in XRD. V2 bonding will use xUSDC/sUSD as retrievable bonds.
