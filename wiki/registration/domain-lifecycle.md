# Domain Lifecycle

---

> **🎉 V2 APPROVED:** The RNS community has voted to approve the V2 upgrade! Domains are already forever assets in the current system with no expiry or renewals. V2 will introduce a "bonding" system that allows you to retrieve your bond amount. See the [RNS V2 Bonding System](wiki/registration/v2-bonding-system.md) for full details.

> **⚠️ MIGRATION COST WARNING:** Current domain purchases (V1) require **additional funds** to migrate to V2. V1 costs are **NOT recoverable** - you'll need to pay bond amounts separately. Consider this before purchasing domains now.

## Evolution of RNS: From Renewals to Forever Assets

### Historical Context
RNS has evolved significantly through community governance:

1. **Original System (Discontinued):** Domains required annual renewals and could expire
2. **Community Vote #1:** RNS community voted to eliminate renewals and make domains forever assets
3. **Current System:** Domains are permanent with one-time XRD purchases
4. **Community Vote #2 (Recent):** RNS community approved V2 bonding system for fund retrievability

### Why the Change Was Made
The community recognized that renewal-based systems created several issues:
- **User Experience:** Constant renewal reminders and risk of losing domains
- **Complexity:** Grace periods, lapse auctions, and expiration management
- **Barrier to Adoption:** Fear of losing valuable domains due to missed renewals
- **Technical Overhead:** Complex lifecycle management and auction systems

The vote to make domains forever assets addressed these concerns by simplifying the system and providing permanent ownership security.

## Current System: Forever Assets

Domains in RNS are **forever assets** with no expiration dates or renewal requirements. Once you purchase a domain, it's yours with no additional costs.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **No expiration dates** - domains never expire
- ✅ **No renewal fees** - one-time purchase only  
- ✅ **Permanent ownership** - yours forever once purchased
- ✅ **Immediate activation** - domains work immediately after purchase
- ⚠️ **V2 migration required** - current domains will need migration to V2 bonding system

## What Happened to Renewals?

Through community governance, renewals, grace periods, and lapse auctions have been **completely removed** from RNS. The community voted to simplify the system and provide permanent domain ownership through one-time purchases.

**Removed features (by community vote):**
- ❌ Annual renewal fees
- ❌ Grace periods  
- ❌ Lapse auctions
- ❌ Domain expiration
- ❌ Renewal reminders
- ❌ Complex lifecycle management

**This was a deliberate community decision** to prioritize user experience and permanent ownership over the traditional renewal model used by other name services.

## V2 Migration (When Available)

While domains are already forever assets, V2 will introduce additional benefits:

### ⚠️ Migration Requires Additional Payment
- **V1 purchase costs cannot be recovered** during migration
- **V2 migration requires new bond funds** (xUSDC/sUSD)
- **This is essentially paying twice** for the same domain
- Migration is optional but required for full RNS functionality

### Current Forever Assets vs V2 Bonding
| Feature | Current System | V2 Bonding System |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Ownership Duration** | Forever | Forever (until unbonded) |
| **Payment** | One-time (XRD) *non-recoverable* | Retrievable bond (xUSDC/sUSD) *by burning domain* |
| **Get Money Back** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (but domain is burned) |
| **Expiration** | Never | Never (unless you unbond) |
| **Migration Required** | N/A | ✅ Required + Additional cost |

### Benefits of V2 Bonding
- **Retrievable Bond**: Get your money back by **burning the domain**
- **Stable currency**: Use xUSDC/sUSD instead of XRD
- **Trading floor price**: Bond amount sets natural minimum price
- **Open source**: Support transition to fully open-source project
- **⚠️ Cost**: Requires additional financial commitment on top of V1 costs
- **⚠️ Trade-off**: You must choose between keeping the domain OR getting money back

## FAQ

---

> #### Do I need to do anything with my current domains?

Not immediately. Your current domains remain yours forever. When V2 launches, you'll have the option to migrate them to the bonding system for additional benefits, **but this will require additional funds equal to the bond amount.**

> #### What if I don't migrate to V2?

Your domains will remain in your possession but may lose some RNS functionality until migrated. Domain names are protected from duplication in V2. **You won't get your V1 purchase money back.**

> #### Can I still lose my domain somehow?

No, domains are forever assets in both systems. However, in V2 you can **voluntarily burn your domain** through unbonding to retrieve the bond funds (but only the V2 bond, not V1 costs). This is a permanent, irreversible choice.

> #### When do I need to migrate?

Migration timeline will be announced when V2 is ready to launch. You'll have a user-friendly interface to migrate your domains when the time comes. **Budget for the additional bond costs.**

> #### Should I buy domains now or wait for V2?

**Different approaches have different implications:**
- **Buy now**: Secures the name immediately but requires V1 cost + V2 migration cost
- **Wait for V2**: Only requires bond amount once but risks losing the domain name to someone else

Each user should evaluate their own priorities and circumstances.

> #### How does V2 unbonding work?

Unbonding **burns your domain** in exchange for returning the bond funds. You cannot keep both the domain and get the money back - it's one or the other. For monetizing domains while preserving them, marketplace trading is available.

> #### What are my options for monetizing a V2 domain?

**Two different methods:**
1. **Trading:** Sell domain on marketplace → Get money + buyer gets the domain
2. **Unbonding:** Burn domain → Get bond amount back + domain is destroyed forever

These are different methods with different outcomes and implications.
