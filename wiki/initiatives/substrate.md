# Substrate Initiative

The Substrate initiative positions RNS as a key enabler of decentralized identity and namespace management, offering a path to modernization for existing name services while opening doors for those without one to build robust and secure solutions for their ecosystems.

---

The RNS Substrate initiative is designed to empower existing name services by allowing them to leverage the full suite of tools, governance structures, and protocols offered by the RNS. This future-oriented initiative reflects the foresight of the RNS Foundation, aiming to work collaboratively with other networks rather than competing with them, thus, creating a well defined and organised Web3 than a fragmented and confusing space. The Substrate essentially functions as a "bolt-on" solution for these networks, enabling them to seamlessly integrate RNS's ecosystem within their own infrastructure.


## Preparations

The RNS has proactively reserved several Apex Handles for integration with well-known name services and DLT ecosystems. These include:

@ens (Ethereum Name Service)<br />
@hns (Handshake)<br />
@unstoppable (Unstoppable Domains)<br />
@sol (Solana)<br />
@dot (Polkadot)<br />
@trx (Tron)<br />
@eth (Ethereum)<br />
@btc (Bitcoin)<br />
...and many more across the DLT and name service space.

This approach ensures that name services and blockchain networks can quickly integrate and leverage the RNS's tools, facilitating immediate bridging of identities, aliases, and namespaces.

## How it Works
Networks that participate in the RNS Substrate will have rights to their corresponding Apex Handle and Genus Registry, allowing them to issue and bridge aliases on a 1:1 basis between their existing systems and the Radix Name Service. This flexibility ensures that name services can be extended into the Web3 environment without the need for extensive reconfiguration or administrative burden.

For DLT networks that do not currently have a name service, the RNS Substrate will allow them to set up a fully-fledged name service with minimal effort. These networks will gain access to the RNS's comprehensive governance, decentralized architecture, and extensive tooling, giving them a jumpstart in the world of decentralized identity and naming without needing to build from scratch.

## Key Advantages

By integrating with the RNS Substrate, name services and networks unlock the following benefits:

**Seamless Web3 Integration:** Bolt the RNS's ecosystem onto existing infrastructures, enabling 1:1 alias bridging between Web2 and Web3.<br />
**Access to Powerful Tools:** Take advantage of the RNS's governance, security, and decentralized management features.<br />
**Streamlined Setup:** For networks lacking a name service, the RNS Substrate offers a fully operational name service without the need for complex setup or administration.<br />
**Cost Efficiency:** Minimal overhead and cost are associated with transitioning name services to Web3, making it an attractive option for both small and large networks.<br />
**Future-Proofing:** Align with the cutting edge of Web3 technology, future-proofing name services while unlocking innovative features like decentralized identity management and namespace governance.
