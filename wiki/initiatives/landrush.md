# Landrush Initiative

---

In January, 2023, the founders of the Radix Name Service ran a 'landrush' initiative. This allowed anybody to register a personal domain name and was put in place to ensure that supporters and the Radix Community were covered by a domain name. This event took place over a single weekend and we received 10000+ domain registrations.

As the Radix Name Service is now on mainnet, XRD Domains has developed a <a href="https://my.xrd.domains/claims" target="_blank">ROLA based claims portal</a> to allow successful applicants to claim their domains. You can read more about this over at the official <a href="https://docs.xrd.domains/#/wiki/initiatives/landrush" target="_blank">XRD Domains Wiki</a>.

## FAQ

---

> #### I took part in the landrush event and my application was accepted, when does my domain claim / eligibility expire?

All landrush domains have a fixed expiration date of 1st March 2025 (UTC). Any eligibile domains that aren't claimed before this date will drop into general circulation.
<br /><br />

> #### I took part in the landrush event, however, my domain is marked as declined?

We had to manually review every landrush application subsequent to the event, as many of the registrations broke the terms of service. As a result, we held an appeals process over a number of weeks to allow applicants to review their application status and lodge an appeal. Your application was declined as it broke the terms of service and / or you did not submit an appeal (or sufficient evidence to prove a personal use case) for the domain during the appeals window.

> #### As the landrush event took place during Olympia, how can I now claim via my Babylon address?

Your smart accounts were automatically migrated, so the Babylon equivalent of your Olympia accounts can still be accessed via the official Radix Babylon Wallet (either via the seed phrase or a ledger device).
<br /><br />

> #### I would like to change the address to which the domain is minted, can I do this?

Of course. As long as you have access to the account under which you previously applied for the domain, you can use our claims portal to mint your domain to another address. Simply select "claim to a different address" during the claims process for each domain accordingly.
