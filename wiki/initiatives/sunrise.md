# Sunrise Initiative

---

The 'sunrise' initiative was a reservation process that commenced within the first week of the RNS announcement for projects, validator services and RDX Works associates, whereby domains were reserved for these entities before general availability. This main purpose of the sunrise initiative was to reduce the chances of domain squatting and impersonation for critical Radix services and associated entities.
