# Models: Voting

The Radix Name Service employs a locking mechanism for $RNS tokens to ensure Sybil protection while maintaining flexibility and enabling concurrent voting. This approach enhances the protocolâ€™s governance by incentivizing participation and preventing abuse, without relying on manual snapshot processes. Here are the key components of the $RNS token locking mechanism.

---

## Locking Mechanism Overview

### Locking Periods

**LP Tokens:** Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens are locked for a period of 7 days.<br />
**Collateral:** Tokens used as collateral for proposals are locked until the proposal's completion or resignation.

In return for locking $RNS tokens, participants receive $gRNS tokens, which are soulbound governance tokens used to vote on DAO matters. This mechanism ensures that voting power is tied to active participation and commitment to the DAO.

### Technical Specifications

##### 1. Token Locking Details

**LP Tokens:** When liquidity providers deposit LP tokens into The Radix Name Service, these tokens are locked for 7 days. This lockup ensures stability and prevents rapid fluctuations in liquidity that could impact the protocol.<br />
**Collateral Locking:** Tokens committed as collateral for Protocol Improvement Proposals (PIPs) or other DAO-related activities are locked until the associated proposal is either completed or formally withdrawn. This lock-up period helps ensure that participants are committed to the outcomes of their proposals.

##### 2. $gRNS Token Issuance

**Issuance Mechanism:** Participants receive $gRNS tokens on a 1:1 basis relative to the amount of $RNS locked. For instance, if a participant locks 1,000 $RNS tokens, they receive 1,000 $gRNS tokens.<br />
**Soulbound Nature:** $gRNS tokens are soulbound to the address that locked the $RNS tokens. This means they cannot be transferred or sold, ensuring that voting power remains tied to the original participant's commitment.

##### 3. Sybil Protection and Voting Flexibility

**Sybil Protection:** The locking mechanism mitigates Sybil attacks by requiring participants to lock tokens to receive $gRNS tokens. This discourages the creation of multiple addresses to gain voting power without real commitment.<br />
**Concurrent Voting:** The $gRNS system allows for free and concurrent voting without the need for manual snapshots. Since $gRNS tokens are issued based on token locking actions, votes can be cast in real-time, enabling a highly scalable and responsive governance process.

##### 4. Voting Rights and Delegation

**Voting Rights:** $gRNS tokens grant voting rights within the DAO. Token holders can vote on proposals and governance issues, contributing to the decision-making process.<br />
**Delegation:** While $gRNS tokens are soulbound, participants can delegate their voting rights to trusted representatives. Delegation is managed through a delegation badge, which tracks the delegated voting power. This system ensures that even soulbound tokens can be effectively utilized for governance while maintaining Sybil protection.

##### 5. No Snapshot Requirements

**Automated Voting:** The locking mechanism and $gRNS issuance ensure that voting does not require manual snapshots. Voting power is automatically adjusted based on the amount of $RNS locked, enabling a seamless and decentralized voting process.

By implementing this token locking mechanism, The Radix Name Service effectively balances the need for sybil protection with the desire for an agile, real-time decentralized governance system with reduced administrative overhead.
