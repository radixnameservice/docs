# Models: Facilitators

To ensure long-term commitment, stability, and effective management of the DAO's roadmap, a vesting mechanism is in place for the founding team, referred to as Facilitators. This mechanism is designed to incentivize both ongoing participation and milestone-based achievements. The system balances between linear vesting and conditional rewards tied to the success of the DAO in reaching critical growth milestones, known as Adoption Eras.

The DAO also has specific procedures for resolving disputes among facilitators, defines mechanisms for a facilitator's resignation, and establishes an AWOL policy for The Radix Name Service project. The goal is to ensure the stability and long-term growth of the DAO, while maintaining fairness and accountability among the founding team.

The Team Vesting Mechanism is designed to ensure that the founding team (facilitators) remains deeply committed to the long-term success of the DAO. By combining a linear vesting schedule with conditional bonuses tied to key adoption milestones, the system aligns the incentives of the facilitators with the overall growth of the platform. This approach ensures that the facilitators not only remain engaged but are also motivated to push the DAO toward full adoption and long-term success.

## Facilitator Allocation

The founding team, consisting of four Facilitators, is allocated **12%** of the overall token supply. This allocation is vested linearly over a period of 2 years, providing a steady stream of tokens as the facilitators actively contribute to the DAO's growth and management.

**Vesting Period:** 2 years<br />
**Vesting Allocation:** 3% each for the four facilitators, equating to a total of 12% of the token supply.<br />
**Purpose:** To incentivize continuous involvement in guiding the DAO, executing the adoption roadmap, and ensuring successful development and expansion of The Radix Name Service.

This linear vesting schedule ensures that facilitators are rewarded gradually and remain aligned with the long-term success of the DAO.

## Facilitator Bonuses

#### DAO Adoption Eras

The DAO Adoption Eras represent key growth milestones in the DAO's development. As each era is achieved, conditional bonuses are unlocked for the facilitators. These milestones are essential in tracking the growth of the Radix Name Service and the broader DAO ecosystem:

- **Era 25k:** Early-stage adoption, representing the first wave of substantial growth and engagement.
- **Era 125k:** Mid-stage adoption, where the platform achieves significant adoption and maturity.
- **Era 250k:** Late-stage adoption, indicating full-scale adoption and a mature DAO ecosystem.
Reaching each era reflects a pivotal moment in the DAO’s expansion, with facilitators playing a critical role in guiding the DAO through these phases.

In addition to the base allocation, **8%** of the overall token supply is reserved as conditional bonus rewards. These rewards are unlocked as the DAO achieves its Adoption Eras, which are major milestones in the growth and adoption of the DAO’s services. The Adoption Eras represent critical phases of the DAO's maturity and expansion.

#### Adoption Eras:
- **Era 25k:** The first major milestone, representing initial traction and adoption.
- **Era 125k:** A mid-stage milestone, indicating significant growth and usage of the DAO.
- **Era 250k:** The final adoption milestone, reflecting a fully mature and widely adopted DAO ecosystem.

Each era unlocks a proportional share of the conditional bonus for the facilitators, distributed evenly among them based on their contributions to helping the DAO reach these stages.

**8% Total Bonus Supply:** Proportionally unlocked at each Adoption Era.<br />
**Equal Distribution:** Each facilitator receives an equal share of the unlocked rewards.<br />
**Purpose:** To further incentivize facilitators to help the DAO reach its growth and adoption milestones, ensuring that they remain committed to the long-term success of the platform.

## Dispute Resolution

In the event of disputes or disagreements between facilitators regarding the direction of the project, vesting terms, or any significant operational decisions, the following steps shall be taken:

**Internal Discussion:** The facilitators should first attempt to resolve the matter through direct discussion during a scheduled meeting. The meeting should be documented, and each facilitator should state their position clearly, aiming to reach a mutual agreement.<br />
**Mediation Proposal:** If the issue remains unresolved after internal discussions, the matter will be raised within the DAO community for a mediation proposal. This is done by submitting a DAO proposal, where both sides of the dispute present their arguments, and community members provide feedback.<br />
**Community Vote:** If mediation fails, the dispute will be escalated to a formal DAO vote. Community members holding $gRNS tokens will vote on the resolution, with a quorum of 50% needed for the decision to be valid. The outcome of this vote will be binding for all facilitators.<br />
**Early Leaver Status:** If the dispute involves allegations of misconduct or failure to meet obligations by one of the facilitators, the other facilitators may issue a notice, potentially leading to the designation of the facilitator in question as an Early Leaver (as outlined in the vesting agreement). A unanimous decision is required from the remaining facilitators to remove a facilitator in this case.

Mediation Proposals will adhere to the following steps:

1. **Proposal Submission:** A party initiates the mediation process by submitting a formal Mediation Proposal to the DAO.
2. **Mediator Appointment:** The DAO votes to appoint a neutral mediator or mediation team from within or outside the DAO.
3. **Mediation Process:** The mediator facilitates discussions between disputing parties, ensuring that all views are considered and working toward a resolution.
4. **Resolution Proposal:** If successful, the mediator drafts a resolution proposal to be reviewed and accepted by the disputing parties or voted upon by the DAO.
5. **Implementation:** Once a resolution is reached, the agreed-upon outcome is implemented, and the dispute is formally closed.

## Resignation Procedure

If a faciliatator voluntarily wishes to step down from the project, the following process must be adhered to:

**Written Notice:** The resigning facilitator must provide written notice to all other facilitators, specifying the reason for stepping down and suggesting a timeline for their departure.<br />
**Token Vesting and Badge Removal:** 
- If the resignation occurs within the first year of the Vesting Period, the facilitator will be classified as an Early Leaver and will forfeit any unvested tokens.
- The facilitator’s admin badge will be destroyed via an internal proposal and multi-sig process among the remaining facilitators.<br />
**IP Transfer:** The resigning facilitator must transfer any project-related Intellectual Property (IP) they possess to The Radix Name Service to ensure the continuity of the project.<br />
**Community Announcement:** A formal announcement should be made to the DAO community, informing them of the facilitator’s resignation and providing a clear explanation of the next steps in terms of project governance and redistribution of responsibilities.

## AWOL Policy

To maintain transparency, fairness, and ongoing commitment, an Absent Without Leave (AWOL) policy is implemented. This policy ensures that facilitators who consistently fail to meet their obligations are held accountable.

**Definition of AWOL:** A facilitator will be considered AWOL if they fail to fulfill their agreed-upon obligations for a cumulative period of 12 weeks within the vesting period, without reasonable explanation.
Process for Handling AWOL facilitators:

**Initial Warning:** After 6 weeks of unexplained absence or failure to meet responsibilities, the remaining facilitators must issue a formal warning, both in writing and through a DAO notice.<br />
**12-Week Absence:** If the facilitator continues to be absent or unresponsive for 12 weeks in total, the other facilitators will have the authority to terminate the absent facilitator’s vesting rights.<br />
**Vote of No Confidence:** After 12 weeks of absence, the remaining facilitators will raise a Motion of No Confidence through a mediation proposal. If passed by a simple majority (50%) in the DAO vote, the following will occur:
- The absent facilitator will lose any unvested tokens.
- The facilitator’s admin badge will be destroyed via multi-sig approval by the remaining facilitators.
- The responsibilities of the removed facilitator will be redistributed among the remaining facilitators or delegated to other key community members, with the approval of the DAO community.

## Conditions for facilitator Removal

In addition to voluntary resignation and AWOL status, a facilitator may be forcibly removed for serious breaches of their obligations or misconduct, as follows:

**Breach of Duties:** If a facilitator fails to uphold their responsibilities, commits a breach of the DAO’s principles, or acts in a way detrimental to the project's interests, the remaining facilitators can propose a Motion of No Confidence to the DAO.<br />
**Community Vote:** A vote of no confidence must be initiated within the DAO. If the vote passes, the facilitator will lose their remaining unvested tokens and their role within the foundation.<br />
**IP Transfer and Treasury Badge:** The removed facilitator must transfer all remaining project IP to The Radix Name Service, and their admin badge will be revoked via the resolution process.

## Succession Planning

To ensure smooth transitions and prevent bottlenecks, the following measures will be taken:

**1. Delegation of Responsibilities:** Each facilitator should proactively delegate aspects of their role to trusted members of the DAO to avoid over-centralization of duties.<br />
**2. Succession Plan:** A clear succession plan will be established, identifying potential replacements or co-leaders from within the community, especially for key technical and leadership roles.<br />
**3. DAO Transition:** Over time, all responsibilities of the founding team will gradually be transitioned to the community as the DAO matures, minimizing reliance on any individual facilitator.
