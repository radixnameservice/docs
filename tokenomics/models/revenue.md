# Models: Revenue

The Radix Name Service incorporates a carefully designed fee system that ensures the perpetual innovation, sustainability, and self-supporting nature of the DAO. These fees not only cover operational costs but also foster continued development, protecting the community's interests while supporting the long-term evolution and success of the protocol.

---

#### 1. Apex Handle Fees

**Pricing:** The one-time fee of Apex Handles is determined by handle length, with a minimum price denominated in USD. Payments can be made in $XRD or $RNS at their equivalent market value at the time of purchase. The current pricing structure is as follows:

- 2 Character Handles: $240 (e.g. @hi)
- 3 Character Handles: $120 (e.g. @hey)
- 4 Character Handles: $40 (e.g. @hola)
- 5+ Character Handles: $4 (e.g. @hello)

**Discount for $RNS Payments:** Users paying in $RNS receive a 30% discount on all Apex Handles. This initiative encourages the use of the protocol’s native token, integrating it more deeply into the ecosystem and attracting DAO engagement. For example, a 5-character handle priced at $4 (equivalent in XRD) would cost just $2.80 in $RNS.

#### 2. Genus Registry Bond

**Bond Amount:** $100 in $RNS.<br />
**Purpose:** This one-time bond is required to participate in the Genus Registry. It serves to deter malicious or speculative handle registrations that might pose risks to the DAO or conflict with existing name services.<br />
**Locking and Withdrawal:** The bond is locked upon submission and is withdrawable after a two-week settlement period once the genus registry goes live. This period ensures thorough vetting and serious engagement from participants.<br />
**Penalty for Dispute:** If a handle registration is subject to a successful dispute and is ultimately rejected, the bond is forfeited. Additionally, a 25% penalty of the bond amount is allocated to The RNS Foundation to cover administrative costs and support the protocol’s operations. This penalty serves as a deterrent against attempts to game the system.

#### 3. Genus Registry Fees

**Standard Fees:** 10% of the overall sales revenue from genus auctions, drop auctions, rents, and any paid genus aliases. These fees are essential for the maintenance and enhancement of the Genus Registry.<br />
**Discount for $RNS Payments:** Fees are reduced to 7.5% if a genus alias is purchased using $RNS. This discount encourages the use of the protocol’s native token, fosters closer integration with the ecosystem and attracts DAO engagement.<br />
**Free Aliases:** Genus aliases issued at no charge do not incur any fees, as they do not generate revenue for the registry.

#### 4. Future Proposal: Assurance Pool Premium Fees

**Premium Fee:** 7.5% on top of the annual premium charged by an underwriter.<br />
**Purpose:** The Assurance Pool provides parametric assurance for registries, offering coverage for potential disputes and ensuring robust protection for users. The additional fee supports the administrative costs and risk management associated with the assurance feature.
