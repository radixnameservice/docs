# Models: Close Periods

Facilitators play a crucial role in the governance and operations of The Radix Name Service, providing oversight, guidance, and mediation to ensure smooth functionality. To maintain the integrity of The Radix Name Service and prevent potential conflicts of interest, facilitators are subject to Close Periods under certain conditions. These Close Periods are designed to prevent facilitators from engaging in activities that could be viewed as taking advantage of privileged information for personal gain, particularly when it comes to trading $RNS tokens.

It is important to note that these restrictions are conditional upon whether or not the $RNS token is actively trading on an exchange. If the $RNS token is not listed or publicly traded, these Close Periods will not apply.

#### What Are Close Periods?
Close Periods refer to specific timeframes during which facilitators are prohibited from buying, selling, or trading $RNS tokens due to their access to sensitive, non-public information. This measure ensures fairness, transparency, and trust within The Radix Name Service and prevents the misuse of insider information.

#### Conditions for Close Periods

Facilitators will be subject to Close Periods under the following conditions:

**1. Within 1 Month of Key Information:**

If the $RNS token is trading on an exchange, facilitators are not allowed to trade within one month of receiving or being exposed to any key information that could influence the token’s value. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Major protocol upgrades or changes
- Significant governance decisions
- Large-scale partnerships or integrations
- Tokenomics changes or distribution events

**2. Sensitive Announcements:**

Facilitators are also restricted from trading $RNS tokens before major public announcements or events that could impact token prices.

#### Purpose of Close Periods

The implementation of Close Periods serves several important purposes:

- Prevention of Insider Trading: Facilitators, by virtue of their role, have access to privileged information. Close Periods prevent them from unfairly leveraging this information for personal profit.
- Maintaining Trust and Transparency: The Radix Name Service relies on a transparent and fair governance process. Close Periods ensure that facilitators act in the best interest of the community and avoid any actions that could be perceived as unethical.
- Market Stability: Preventing facilitators from making trades based on insider knowledge protects the $RNS token’s market integrity, ensuring that all participants have access to the same information before making trading decisions.

#### Enforcement

Violations of the Close Periods policy will be taken seriously and may result in:

- Immediate Suspension or Removal: Facilitators found to be in breach of the policy may be suspended or removed from their position.
- Further Disciplinary Actions: Depending on the severity of the violation, additional consequences such as fines, restrictions, or DAO governance actions may be enforced to uphold the protocol's integrity.

This policy is a critical aspect of maintaining the fairness and credibility of The Radix Name Service, ensuring that all actions by facilitators align with the community’s best interests.
