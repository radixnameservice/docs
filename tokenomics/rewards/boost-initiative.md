# Rewards: Boost Initiative

To further incentivize participation and support the growth of the DAO, the Boost Rewards program allocates **2,000,000 $RNS tokens**, which represents **20%** of the overall supply of $RNS tokens to the Boost Initiative. This initiative aims to provide a significant boost to rewards generated from various DAO activities, including streams, pools, and dQueue operations. The Boost Rewards will enhance these activities by 25% until the allocated tokens are depleted.

## How Boost Rewards Work

The Boost Rewards mechanism is designed to amplify the benefits of participating in key DAO functions by offering increased rewards. Here's a breakdown of how this initiative integrates with DAO activities:

##### 1. Increased Rewards for DAO Activities

**Boost Amount:** All $RNS rewards from stream, pool, and dQueue activities will be boosted by an additional 25%.<br />
**Duration:** This boosted reward rate will continue until the allocated 20% of the overall $RNS supply is fully distributed.

##### 2. Activities Eligible for Boost Rewards

**Streams:** Portions of DAO revenue are redistributed to Stream Subscribers, who receive rewards based on their participation in either the Surety Stream or Liquidity Stream.<br />
**Pools:** Rewards for participating in liquidity pools or other DAO liquidity mechanisms.<br />
**dQueues:** Rewards for participating in decentralized queue operations, which might include governance or operational tasks within the DAO.

## Key Advantages

**Enhanced Incentives:** The additional 25% boost significantly increases the attractiveness of participating in DAO activities, encouraging more engagement and contribution.<br />
**Support for Growth:** By allocating 20% of the overall token supply to this initiative, the DAO provides crucial support to drive participation and operational activities, contributing to overall growth.<br />
**Encouragement for Early Participation:** Boost Rewards incentivize users to engage early and consistently, capitalizing on the increased rewards while the allocation lasts.
