# Rewards: Engagement

The Engagement Rewards mechanism is a strategic component in the upcoming Adoption Eras of The Radix Name Service, designed to foster user interaction and community growth. **1,000,000 $RNS tokens**, which represents **10%** of the total $RNS token supply is allocated to engagement rewards. This allocation is divided across different phases of DAO adoption, referred to as "Adoption Eras", with specific percentages of rewards unlocked at each stage.

## Functionality

The Faciliators propose that the DAO tenders development of a suite of tools that allows users to connect their social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Discord, and Telegram to their RNS handles / aliases. Once integrated, users can display their Apex Names (identifiers within The Radix Name Service) in their social media profiles or share official content from The Radix Name Service to earn rewards. In return for their engagement, users will receive fortnightly $RNS airdrops to their connected addresses. This reward mechanism continues until the engagement reward pool is fully depleted for the Era.

## Era Breakdown

Three distinct adoption phases will unlock portions of $RNS that will be progressively disbursed as Engagement Rewards:

**25k Era:** 500,000 $RNS tokens<br />
**50k Era:** 300,000 $RNS tokens<br />
**125k Era:** 200,000 $RNS tokens

This tiered structure ensures a total of 1,000,000 $RNS tokens are distributed across all three phases as engagement rewards. This model incentivizes user engagement at key growth stages while ensuring a sustainable allocation across the protocol's entire adoption cycle.

## Participation

To participate in the Engagement Rewards program and claim $RNS tokens, users must actively engage with The Radix Name Service and integrate their social media presence with the platform. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to get involved and claim rewards:

##### 1. Link Your Social Media Accounts<br />
Users must first link their social media accounts (such as X, Discord, or Telegram) to The Radix Name Service using the soon-to-be-released social-oriented tools. This step is necessary for the protocol to track engagement and allocate rewards accordingly.
<br />
**Supported Platforms:** X (formerly Twitter), Discord, Telegram<br />
**Integration Process:** Follow the integration guide provided by the protocol to securely link your social media accounts to your RNS handle / alias.

##### 2. Display Your Apex Name<br />

Once your social media accounts are linked, you can display your Apex Name (a unique identifier within The Radix Name Service) in your social media handles. This serves as a signal that you are an active participant in the RNS ecosystem and qualifies you for rewards.
<br />
**How to Display:** Add your Apex Name to your username or bio on X, Discord, and Telegram, making it visible to others on the platform.

##### 3. Engage with Official RNS Content
To earn rewards, participants must actively engage with official RNS content on social media. This can include:

- Sharing or retweeting posts from the official RNS accounts.
- Creating and sharing your own content related to the protocol (e.g., tutorials, updates, news).
- Participating in discussions within official Discord or Telegram groups.

##### 4. Fortnightly Airdrops of $RNS
Once your social media profiles are connected and you're engaging with RNS content, you will automatically be eligible to receive $RNS tokens through fortnightly airdrops.
<br />

**Frequency:** Airdrops occur every two weeks.<br />
**Claim Mechanism:** $RNS tokens will be sent directly to your connected wallet address without any need for manual claiming, making the process seamless and automated.<br />
**Reward Size:** The amount of $RNS tokens you receive will depend on the extent and quality of your engagement (such as the number of shares, posts, and other interactions with official content).

##### 5. Monitor the Engagement Pool<br />
The engagement rewards pool for each era will be gradually depleted as tokens are distributed. It's important to stay informed about the current status of the pool and the remaining rewards available.

**Check Engagement Pool Status:** Regular updates will be available in the Engagement Rewards section of the protocol, where users can see how much of the reward pool remains.

##### 6. Optimize Your Participation

To maximize your rewards:

- Stay active on all supported social platforms (X, Discord, Telegram) and engage consistently with official content.
- Share your Apex Name widely within your network.
- Follow community updates and participate in any special campaigns or events organized by the protocol.

## Key Advantages

**Increased Exposure:** By encouraging users to display Apex Names or share RNS content, the platform gains more visibility across social media, effectively spreading awareness and promoting adoption.<br />
**User Engagement:** Engagement rewards incentivize users to stay active within the ecosystem, interact with its content, and contribute to community growth, leading to a more vibrant and active user base.<br />
**Decentralized Incentive Model:** The use of DAO to fund and disburse rewards ensures that the process remains decentralized and community-driven. The DAO can adjust and refine the engagement rewards program based on user feedback and evolving needs.<br />
**Fortnightly Rewards:** The consistent reward cycle (every two weeks) helps maintain momentum and engagement over time, encouraging sustained involvement rather than one-off participation.<br />
**Gamification of Participation:** The ability to earn $RNS tokens simply by interacting on social media platforms and sharing content gamifies the experience, making it more enjoyable for users while simultaneously promoting the protocol.<br />
**Support for Ecosystem Development:** The funding for building social-oriented tools also signals the protocol's commitment to continuously improving the ecosystem, offering users seamless ways to connect with the platform.
