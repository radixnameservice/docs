# Rewards: Pools

The Radix Name Service utilizes three key types of pools - the Maintenance Pool, the Endorsement Bonus Rewards Pool and the Stream Runoff Pool to manage and distribute $RNS rewards efficiently. Each pool serves a distinct purpose, ensuring that protocol operations and participant incentives are maintained, even during periods of lower activity or demand and provides targeted rewards for crucial activities such as protocol maintenance, liquidity provision, and proposal endorsement, ensuring the smooth functioning of the protocol and engagement from the community.

---

## 1. Maintenance Pool

The Maintenance Pool plays a critical role in funding the ongoing operations and maintenance of the protocol, particularly through the execution of dQueue tasks. This pool is funded by 5% of the DAO's revenue and is used to compensate participants who perform essential protocol functions, such as recalling expired genus names or executing other routine tasks.

##### How the Maintenance Pool Works

- **Funding Source:** 1% of all DAO revenue is allocated to the Maintenance Pool.
- **Reward Distribution:** Participants who execute tasks in the dQueue are rewarded with $RNS tokens from this pool. These rewards cover transaction fees and provide additional incentives for task completion.
- **Demand-Based Rewards:** The Maintenance Pool's disbursement is regulated through a dynamic cap system that adjusts rewards based on the volume of tasks pending in the dQueue. The more tasks there are in the queue, the higher the potential rewards, ensuring that tasks are completed promptly.

## 2. Stream Runoff Pool

The Stream Runoff Pool serves as a secondary rewards mechanism, designed to capture surplus rewards when there are no active participants in certain Reward Streams. The Stream Runoff Pool ensures that DAO-generated revenue is not wasted but rather held for later distribution, providing bonuses to future subscribers.

## 3. Endorsement Bonus Pool

The Endorsement Bonus Rewards Pool is designed to incentivize the community to endorse and support new proposals within the DAO. This pool receives 10% of the overall DAO revenue, ensuring that there is always a strong incentive for $RNS holders to back proposals through the governance process.

## Key Advantages

**Sustainability:** Both the Maintenance and Stream Runoff Pools are designed with sustainability in mind, ensuring that rewards are distributed proportionally and responsibly based on demand and participation.<br />
**Incentivized Participation:** The dynamic reward system of the Maintenance Pool and the bonus incentives of the Stream Runoff Pool encourage consistent participation, especially during periods of low engagement.<br />
**Efficient Resource Utilization:** The Stream Runoff Pool ensures that no DAO revenue is wasted, accumulating unclaimed rewards and redistributing them when demand returns.<br />
**Risk Mitigation:** By holding surplus funds in the Stream Runoff Pool, the protocol can provide additional rewards to participants during periods of renewed activity, reducing the risks associated with revenue fluctuations.
