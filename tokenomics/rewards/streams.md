# Rewards: Streams

This section explains what Streams are and how they reward DAO participation, liquidity provision and operational incentives within the DAO.

---

## What are Reward Streams?

Streams are portions of DAO Revenue that are re-distributed as variable rewards to **Stream Subscribers**. As per the DAO revenue funnel, 40% of all revenue is divided among subscribers of 2 Reward Streams:

1. **Surety Stream (20%):** Rewards for making certain commitments via mechianisms such as providing collateral for a particular proposal.
2. **Liquidity Stream (20%):** Rewards for liquidity provision.

## Stream Subscriptions

As outlined above, there are various routes available to DAO participants if they wish to subscribe to a Stream. Rewards are proportionally rewarded, at the end of each Radix epoch, to subscribers of a Stream relative to the amount of $RNS they had committed upon subscription and Stream type (i.e. collateral or liquidity provided).

#### **Surety Stream**

**Subscription Routes:** Collateralizing a Protocol Improvement Proposal (PIP).<br />
**Accrual Commencement:** Once the implementation / development of the PIP begins.<br />
**Accrual Ends:** Upon the target delivery date defined on the PIP.


#### **Liquidity Stream**

**Subscription Routes:** Depositing LP tokens via the RNS Governance Portal.<br />
**Accrual Commencement:** Immediately after LP tokens are deposited via the RNS Governance Portal.<br />
**Accrual Ends:** Upon the withdrawl of all LP tokens via the RNS Governance Portal.

## Point of Reward Allocation

As previously stated, 40% of DAO revenue is redistributed as Stream Rewards. These rewards are calculated and reserved for eligible subscribers based on revenue during a certain Radix epoch. All subscribers of all Stream types will be alloted rewards relative to the amount of $RNS committed to a Stream route within the Stream between two epochs.


## Stream Runoff

Surplus rewards that seemingly have no destination or purpose may be generated in the rare instance that no DAO participants are subscribed to a particular Stream. This is defined as **"Stream Runoff"**.  When Runoff occurs, Stream destined revenue is instead deposited into a Stream Runoff Pool. Eventual subscribers are rewarded $RNS that has accumulated within bonuses Stream Runoff Pool, as a form of reward bonus, and are subject to exactly the same method of disbursement as standard Stream Rewards.

A bonus pool of this nature theoretically provides further risk-mitigating incentives for Stream based activities during quieter periods of DAO revenue generation.

## Key Advantages

**Incentivized DAO Participation:** Users are rewarded for collateralizing proposals (Surety Stream) or providing liquidity (Liquidity Stream). This promotes active participation in both governance and protocol health.<br />
**Proportional Reward Distribution:** Participants receive rewards based on their contribution, ensuring fairness. The more $RNS tokens committed, the higher the rewards.<br />
**Flexible Subscription Routes:** Users can choose how they want to engageâ€”either by collateralizing Protocol Improvement Proposals (PIPs) or providing liquidity. This flexibility suits different user preferences.<br />
**Consistent Revenue Stream:** With 40% of all DAO revenue allocated to these streams, participants can rely on regular reward opportunities, keeping the system sustainable and attractive over time.<br />
**Stream Runoff Mechanism:** If a Stream is underutilized, unclaimed rewards flow into a Stream Runoff Pool. These surplus funds accumulate and are later redistributed as bonuses, ensuring no DAO revenue is wasted while encouraging future participation.<br />
