# Token Types: $gRNS

$gRNS tokens are the offical governance tokens for The Radix Name Service. These soulbound tokens are issued to $RNS utility token holders when they participate in various DAO mechanisms, such as those that involve risk-on token locking such as collateralizing PIP's.

### $gRNS Issuance

**$gRNS is issued to DAO participants that partake in any of the following DAO activities:**

- Endorsement and collateralization of Protocol Improvement Proposals (PIP's).
- Locking $RNS LP tokens with the RNS DAO.

**$gRNS tokens are issued under the following specifications:**

- Soulbound to the source address participating in either of the above activities.
- 1:1 to the $RNS committed to either of the above activities.

### Delegation

Even though $gRNS tokens are soulbound, DAO participants who receive $gRNS from the various DAO mechanisms can choose to delegate their voting rights and power to trusted representatives, with whom they might be aligned e.g. philosophy and principles. A few protocols apply when delegating $gRNS:

- DAO representatives can receive delegated voting power if the target address already holds $gRNS (meaning that the elected repesentative is already an active DAO participant).
- A 'delegation' badge is created for each $gRNS delegation which serves as a tracking mechanism for each delegated vote by the trusted representative (sybil protection).
- Revoking a delegation will also revoke any votes that the trusted representative may have lodged for any ongoing (unresolved) motions.

### FAQ

**Why not simply utilize the $RNS utility token instead of a secondary governance token route?**

Issuing a secondary governance specific token has a number of advantages:

**1.** Voting rights are tied to DAO usage and user commitment to DAO mechanisms, not to the $RNS token. If the $RNS token happens to be instantiated on an exchange, holding these tokens does not automatically provide voting rights. Having this degree of separation between holding the $RNS token and voting rights ensures that regulatory risk surrounding the $RNS token is kept to the very minimum.<br /><br />
**2.** Voting is isolated to DAO members that are involved and engaged with The Radix Name Service, whose involvement spans much further than simply holding the $RNS token and are, therefore, more likely to be well-informed decision makers within the DAO. This will ultimately convert to well-informed and lucid resolutions.<br /><br />
**3.** As $gRNS tokens are issued based on locking actions (with $RNS), vote participation doesn't require a snapshot or locking at the $gRNS token level. This means $gRNS holders can freely choose to vote on concurrent proposals and motions, thus, creating a highly scalable, smooth and completely decentralized DAO that doesn't require 3rd party intervention for snapshots.
