### gRNS Privileges

From the 25k Era, gRNS Holders are the final deciding parties and "sign-off" authority for the vast majority of DAO proposals, amendments and applications. RNS processes and governance are organised into stages, for the sake of brevity, to increase ideation quality and participation, and to act as DAO exploit prevention mechanisms. A community mandate is required at the final stages of most DAO mechanisms, at which point, a clarified, well-structured and contemplated draft resolution is ready for a vote - gRNS holders are eligible to vote in order to grant or deny these mandates.
