# Structure: Platform Framework

The Platform Provider Application process allows third-party entities to register as commissioned Platform Providers within The Radix Name Service ecosystem. Platform Providers serve as decentralized shopfronts for the sale of Apex Handles and Genus Domains, earning a share of the revenue through the Platform Provider Commission (10% of the DAO’s revenue). This process is designed to encourage innovation, decentralization, community collaboration, and increased adoption of the protocol.

## Overview

- **Role and Functionality:** Platform Providers are decentralized entities that create unique frontends for users to interact with The Radix Name Service, facilitating the sale of Apex Handles and Genus Domains.
- **Revenue Sharing:** Providers earn 10% of the DAO’s revenue through the Platform Provider Commission, which is tracked and allocated to their vaults for sales facilitated through their platforms.
- **Collaborative Innovation:** Each provider operates independently, driving innovation and improving user experiences, while the success of any single provider benefits the entire RNS ecosystem by increasing adoption and visibility.

## Application Process

Prospective Platform Providers begin by submitting a formal Platform Provider Application (PlatApp):

##### 1. Submission of Application

- **Details of the Provider’s Platform:** Information about the proposed platform interface, target user base, and intended community.
- **Technical Integration Plan:** Explanation of how the provider’s platform will interact with The Radix Name Service for tracking sales and handling revenue.
- **Unique Value Proposition:** Description of the innovation or differentiators the platform will bring to the ecosystem.


##### 2. Issuance of Platform Provider Badge

Once the application is submitted, a Platform Provider Badge Request is issued. This badge enables the tracking of sales and ensures the Platform Provider’s eligibility for $RNS rewards. It also grants the provider the ability to participate in the DAO's governance by voting on proposals.

##### 3. Proposal & Voting Process

The application is automatically converted into a proposal, where DAO members vote on the inclusion of the new Platform Provider. The voting model is based on:

**Voting Model:** gRNS (square-rooted) + domain multiplier.
**Mandate Threshold:** A 51% approval rate is required, with at least 10% participation from the DAO.

If the proposal passes, the applicant is formally recognized as a commissioned Platform Provider and can begin operations within The Radix Name Service ecosystem.

## Operations

Upon approval, the new Platform Provider is free to launch their platform and begin facilitating the sale of Apex Handles and Genus Domains. All sales conducted through their platform will generate a 10% Platform Provider Commission, which is automatically allocated to their vault.

## Obligations

Platform Providers are expected to partake in every single governance vote with a High or Moderate footprint. If a Platform Provider fails to perform these duties to the DAO and community an "AWOL" dispute can be lodged by another Platform Provider(s).

## Revenue Sharing & DAO Participation

Platform Providers will continue to earn 10% of the revenue generated from the protocol that's facilitated via the platform and platform related tools. They also gain the ability to submit proposals and vote on governance matters, contributing to the evolution and development of The Radix Name Service.

## Platform Provider Resignation Process

Platform Providers wishing to resign must submit a Platform Provider Resignation proposal. This proposal includes the request to burn their Platform Provider Badge, thereby ending their ability to facilitate sales and removing their participation rights within the DAO. The platform ceases all sales and commission activity immedately after the resignation request is submitted.
