# Structure: Genus Framework

Apex Handle owners can apply as Genus Registries to unlock self-sustaining communities and sub-ecosystems that can all take advantage of the tooling of The Radix Name Service.

---

## Application Process

To become a Genus Registry operator and unlock the ability to issue and manage domain names within your namespace, Apex Handle owners can follow a structured process through the governance portal:

**1. Ownership of an Apex Handle:** Applicants must own an Apex Handle to be eligible.<br />
**2. Genus Registry Application (RegApp):** Submit a formal application via the RegApp process in the governance portal, initiating the request to create a Genus Registry.<br />
**3. Bond Submission:** Post a bond of $100 in $RNS, which is locked during the two-week settlement period. This bond ensures that applicants are committed and deters frivolous registrations that could pose a litigation risk to the DAO.<br />
**4. Application Settlement (2 Weeks):** The application undergoes a two-week settlement period, during which other parties may raise disputes.

## Dispute Resolution

Disputes are only valid if the proposed Genus Registry poses a litigation risk to the DAO. Examples include conflicting names with existing Web2 or Web3 namespaces, or trademarked entities.

##### Disputed Application

If another party raises a dispute within the two-week window (posting a $100 bond in $RNS), the application is paused for review. If the dispute is successful:

**1.** The application is declined, and the disputer receives 75% of the original applicant's bond.<br />
**2.** The remaining 25% of the bond is allocated to The RNS Foundation to support innovation and protocol sustainability.<br />
**3.** The disputer can withdraw their own bond after the dispute is settled.

##### Successful Application

If the dispute is unsuccessful, or no dispute is raised:

**1.** The applicantâ€™s bond becomes available for withdrawal (refund).<br />
**2.** The registry is officially created, allowing the owner to manage and operate the Genus Registry.

## Operation and Governance

Once the application is approved, the new Genus Registry is established, providing the owner with the following capabilities:

**1. SubDAO Creation:** Each Genus Registry operates under a sub-DAO structure, offering legal protection and governance for their community. This sub-DAO facilitates decentralized management of the namespace.<br />
**2. Domain Issuance:** Registry owners can issue or sell domains under their Genus. Owners can choose from several issuance models, including:

- **Auction Model:** Domains can be auctioned to the highest bidder.
- **Flat Fee Model:** Domains can be sold for a one-time fee.
- **Renewal Model:** Domains can be issued with annual, bi-annual, or custom renewal fees.
- **Tapered Pricing:** Fees can be adjusted based on domain length (e.g. shorter domains = higher price).

## Sub DAO

Each Genus Registry operates under a sub-DAO, which offers legal protections for the Genus operator and their namespace. This decentralized governance structure ensures:

**Autonomy and Ownership:** The sub-DAO provides legal safeguards for the operator, allowing them to run a governance driven genus community independently, while being protected from liabilities arising as a result of sub-DAO resolutions.<br />
**Governance and Decision-Making:** Through the sub-DAO, operators have full governance control over their namespace, meaning they can set the rules for how domains are issued, priced, or managed within their community.<br />
**Protection from Disputes:** Should any legal or operational issues arise, the sub-DAO structure provides a clear framework for resolving disputes, both internally and with external parties, ensuring the Genus Registry remains legally compliant and sustainable.

## Registry Resignation

Registry operators can voluntarily resign from their role, ceasing all sales or issuance of genus aliases. The associated sub-DAO will be frozen, preventing further governance actions. Current aliases are converted to forever domains and remain active.
