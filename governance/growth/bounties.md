# Buildout: Bounties

This section explains how bounties are proposed and deployed in order to ensure steady development of the RNS DAO and Protocol during its early stages.

---

### What are Bounties?

Bounties are well-scoped, commissioned tasks that can claimed by any capable party and are an essential component to the bootstrapping period in the early stages of the DAO (between Era 25k and Era 125k). The reasons for Bounties is to set a standard of well-defined and to maintain an element of stability within the DAO by acting as a guard-railed precursor to PIP derived Treasury Grants. The main goal of Bounties is to ensure that the core build out of the DAO and Protocol functionality is achieved, whilst preventing widespread abuse of what could be currently considered a vulnerable DAO treasury until a certain rate of adoption = stability is achieved.


### Bounty Creation

Each Bounty is created by the Faciliators and is derived from CGP requirements. To ensure that a level of adaptability and flexibility is retain, other Bounties can be created through a method of community feedback and flashpoints.

### Bounty Applications

Once published, multiple applicants can apply to fulfil each Bounty for a certain fee that is paid by the DAO treasury. Each application is reviewed by the Facilitators and goes through a valuation discovery phase in order to discover an ideal cost to value-to-DAO ratio. A vote is cast to decide the best route of Bounty fulfilment and a commencement date is set, along with a development timeline and payment stages. Every successful applicant is expected to:

- Provide regular updates to the Facilitators and DAO regarding stage completion, issues and short to medium term outlook.
- Ensure that every stage of the Bounty is created to the agreed specification.
- Be honest, transparent and openly communicative with the Facilitators and DAO, such as discussing any changes in remit, due to unforeseen issues or inability to complete the Bounty for any reason.
- Prepare and present the DAO with a SOP and merge strategy once all of the Bounty stages are complete.
