# Growth: Protocol Improvement Proposals

This section explains how funding will move from a Bounty based process to an RNS treasury funded model within the 25k Era.

### What are Protocol Improvement Proposals?

Protocol Improvement Proposals (PIP's) allow third parties and current DAO participants to propose improvement to the Radix Name Service functionality or run initiatives that will benefit the service and DAO participants as a whole. Each proposal has a defined structure, with required criteria comprised of:

**1.** Budget / treasury ask and breakdown of costs.<br />
**2.** Five delivery phases and update cycles.<br />
**3.** Target delivery dates.<br />
**4.** Intended primary effects of the proposal and possible side effects. Optional secondary effects.<br />
**5.** Evidence / research to support the implementation having a positive outcome for the DAO and RNS.<br />
**6.** Bio and information to support the proposer's ability to fulfil the implementation the proposal in question.

<br />
Proposals are born out of a process of ideation that is then "Endorsed" by the community. All $RNS holders within the community can collateralize an idea to a relative threshold in return for a portion of the <a href="/#/tokenomics/rewards/streams" target="_blank">Surety Stream</a> rewards. This both partially protects the DAO from exploitation and creates a clear vote of confidence by the community for such a proposal to be put to the DAO Treasury. The proposer can also add collateral to their own proposal to show confidence in their own proposal, thus, evoking confidence from the DAO participants.

### Commencement Threshold

The 'Commencement Threshold' is effectively the tipping point for which a proposer can come forward and commence the implementation of a proposal. This Commencement Threshold is fixed at 25% of the overall treasury ask of a particular proposal.

### Proposal Lifecycle

If a developer or potential project wants to propose an initiative or improvement that benefits the DAO overall, they can:

**1.** The proposer creates a draft proposal within the Governance Portal, along with the required criteria. A process of ideation takes place, of which the community can contribute, scrutinize and show support through via collateralization until the idea is "Endorsed" to an active PIP (once / if it reaches its Commencement Threshold).<br /><br />
**2.** $RNS holders can allocate $RNS by way of collateral to the proposal - collateralizing a proposal at this stage is considered an 'endorsement'. A portion of the <a href="/#/tokenomics/rewards/streams" target="_blank">Surety Stream</a> is allocated to the locking party, along with 'Endorsement Bonus Rewards' once the proposal is commenced.<br /><br />
**3.** Once the proposal is collateralized to a ratio of 25% of the overall treasury ask, the proposer is now set to commence the project, and the funds are released for the first phase (20% of the overall treasury ask).<br /><br />
**4.** The proposer is obliged to provide updates throughout the entire process (raise review requests as per outlined delivery phases) and funding is approved for each stage respectively. The party responsible for approving each subsequent stage depends on which Era the DAO is operatating within.<br />

##### ✅ Completion:
- Once the proposal has been completed, the proposer must present the DAO with a SOP (or GOP for core governance amendments) and merge strategy.
- Once this merge strategy is approved, all collateral on the proposal is unlocked and the accrued Stream rewards become available for withdrawal.

##### ❌ Desertion:
- If the proposer fails to fulfil the project within the agreed timescales + 50% (for the sake of brevity), the collateral ($RNS) is considered lost.
- Accrued Stream rewards are deposited back into the DAO Treasury for reallocation to another proposal / project.

<br />

##### Notable Points

- Proposals can be further collateralized by $RNS holders, in return for Stream Rewards, even after the commencement threshold (to a max of 100% collateralization to cost ratio). Stream rewards will accrue between the moment of collateralization and target delivery date.
- If a proposal fails to be endorsed within 60 days of ideation OR fails to make it past the moderation stage, all collateral can be withdrawn by respective backers.

### Why Collateralized Proposals?

Collateralized in the case of DAO funding adds the following dynamics:

- **Careful Consideration:** When participants collateralize an improvement proposal with their $RNS tokens, stronger elements of trust, levels of confidence and careful consideration are introduced to the mix. This avoids DAO participants partaking in 'haphazard' voting, as real tokens are at stake. This means that DAO participants are more likely to further research, scrutinize a proposal and enforce a nature of trust, when compared to traditional DAO Funding models.
- **Higher Quality Proposals:** Since proposals will likely be taken seriously (due to the nature of risk), the quality of proposals will have to evoke trust from surety providers in the form of collateral.
- **Progressive Funding:**  Potential collateralizing parties are presented with a wide range of risk / reward trade off's when considering the potential outcomes, such as a desertion of a proposal implementation by its respective proposer. The creator of a proposal is incentivized to keep the community up to date with progress and developments during the entire process of fulfilment in order to attract additional collateral (from those that may be more risk averse) which increases the odds of subsquent phase approval (and funding) upon review request.
- **Engagement & Accountability:** $RNS rewards for engagement on this level creates cohesion between builders and other DAO participants, knowledge sharing, insights and collective responsibility throughout the community. 

Risk is very important within DAO's and in most cases, the DAO Treasury takes on most of the risk regarding improvement proposals and funding. Undelivered promises are commonplace and stem from proposals that may have haphazardly been approved by DAO participants due to the fact that such actions pose no immediate risk to said participants, but instead, the DAO Treasury. Ensuring participants are rewarded for careful thought and allocation of their $RNS, and in the case of proposer allocated collateral allows a proposer to make a tangible commitment to tasks at hand.

### What exclusions apply to such funding?

Protocol improvement proposals are very opinionated, in that the incoming proposal MUST provide a direct benefit to the DAO or name service. If a proposal results in the applicant being a direct beneficiary in some way, shape or form (i.e. provides an opportunity to run a profitable operation), then the DAO does not expect to take on financial risk on behalf of the party that can potentially be a longer term direct beneficiary. Reasonable rules of engagement apply, and are measured based on whether the proposed functionality isn't being implementated for a use case of a specific dApp, but instead is being implemented for universal usage / interfacing by the DAO, service, participants and ecosystem developers as a whole.

Incentives for symbiotic developments and integrations exist through platform provider rewards. Integrated apps and utilities that leverage The Radix Name Service can apply to become Official Platform Providers and get rewarded with $RNS based on the volume alias sales / renewals that are processed through said dApp / integration.
